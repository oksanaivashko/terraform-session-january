# Intoduction to Terraform
## What is Terraform?
- Terraform - is a tool for provisioning, managing, and deploying infrastructure resources. It is an open-source tool written in Golang and created by the HashiCorp company. With Terraform, you can manage infrastructure for your applications across multiple cloud providers – AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. – using a single tool.
- One of the key features of Terraform is its declarative syntax. This means that you define what your desired and Terraform figures out the best way to achieve that. 
## What are the benefits of Terraform?
- Utilizing Infrastructure as Code to manage and deploy infrastructure resources.

### Infrastructure as a code
- enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure by running a script. You can do that for every environment, from development to production, passing through staging, QA, and more. IaC can make the entire software development lifecycle more efficient.
- Speed and safety as code enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure by running a script. You can do that for every environment, from the development to the production. You can create a server in the second and delete as well, instead of doing manually. Also, human mistakes and with the code you avoid this problem.
## How does Terraform work?
- Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.
## Terraform offers a declarative approach over an imperative one

- Terraform - is a declarative, it gives you approach to managing infrastructure, because it allows you to focus on exactly what you want the infrastructure to be. You do this by writing code in a definition file in which you can specify the desired state of the infrastructure.
## Terraform enables an immutable infrastructure
- Immutable infrastructure creates distinct resources. To roll an update onto a web server, you need to create a new server with the relevant updates and bring down the old one. Resources are replaced rather than changed over time
