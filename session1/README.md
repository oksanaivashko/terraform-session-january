# Intoduction to Terraform
## What is Terraform?
- Terraform - is a tool for provisioning, managing, and deploying infrastructure resources. It is an open-source tool written in Golang and created by the HashiCorp company. With Terraform, you can manage infrastructure for your applications across multiple cloud providers – AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. – using a single tool.
- One of the key features of Terraform is its declarative syntax. This means that you define what your desired and Terraform figures out the best way to achieve that. 
## How Terraform can improve your DevOps processes
- Terraform allows DevOps Engineers to automate and manage the Data Center Infrastructure, the platforms, and the services that run on those platforms, all from one location, that you can reuse and share.
- Instead of handling the infrastructure manually by logging into the AWS Web Console to create each component of your infrastructure, you just do it in code.

- When you need to change anything in your infrastructure all what you need to do just update the Terraform code and apply it, helping you to automate your cloud infrastructure and configuration.

## Benefits of using Terraform
- Terraform is OpenSource, platform-agnostic and backed by HashiCorp
- Utilizing Infrastructure as Code to manage and deploy infrastructure resources.
- Terraform is Declarative
- Terraform has a large community with enterprise support options

### Infrastructure as a code
- enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure by running a script. You can do that for every environment, from development to production, passing through staging, QA, and more. IaC can make the entire software development lifecycle more efficient.
- Speed and safety as code enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure by running a script. You can do that for every environment, from the development to the production. You can create a server in the second and delete as well, instead of doing manually. Also, human mistakes and with the code you avoid this problem.
## How does Terraform work?
- Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.

## Terraform offers a declarative approach over an imperative one

- Terraform - is a declarative, it gives you approach to managing infrastructure, because it allows you to focus on exactly what you want the infrastructure to be. You do this by writing code in a definition file in which you can specify the desired state of the infrastructure.
## Terraform enables an immutable infrastructure
- Immutable infrastructure creates distinct resources. To roll an update onto a web server, you need to create a new server with the relevant updates and bring down the old one. Resources are replaced rather than changed over time
